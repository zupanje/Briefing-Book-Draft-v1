%This is the present status of the PMNS measurements

The neutrino mixing is described by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, analogous to the CKM matrix in the quark sector, connecting the neutrino mass eigenstates to the flavor eigenstates. It is parameterized by three mixing angles, $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$ and  $\theta_{23}$, and by a complex phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$ (two supplementary phases are present in the case of Majorana neutrinos, but they do not affect the neutrino oscillations). The latter might produce CP violating effects if it is different from 0 and $\pi$. The oscillation experiments are also sensitive to the difference of the masses squared, $\Delta m^2_{21}= m^2_2 -m^2_1$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}= m^2_3 -m^2_1$
where $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_3$ are the  mass eigenvalues. The neutrino mass ordering refers to the two present possibilities: $m_1 < m_2 < m_3$ (normal) or $m_3 < m_1 < m_2$ (inverted), where by convention $m_1 < m_2$ has been chosen, with $\Delta m^2_{21}$ being the parameter governing the oscillation of the solar neutrinos.


We summarize here the results of a global analysis of neutrino oscillation data in the three-flavour framework from the NuFit group \cite{Esteban:2018azc} comprising all available data from solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments. Consistent results are obtained also by other groups \cite{Capozzi:2018ubv,lisi:2019EPSSU_Granada,deSalas:2017kay}. 


To date the determination of the three mixing angles, the complex phase, and the two neutrino mass-squared differences is given in Tab.~\ref{tab:NuFit-results}. The best fit occurs for the normal mass ordering ($\Delta m^2_{31} > 0$), while the inverted ordering is disfavoured with a difference of $\Delta \chi^2 = 9.3$ between the two hypotheses. %An important contribution to this result comes from SuperKamiokande atmospheric neutrino data; without these data the $\Delta\chi^2$ decreases to 4.7. 
The mixing angles $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{13}$ are well measured with relative precision at $3\sigma$ of 14\% and 9\%, respectively. The uncertainty of the third angle $\theta_{23}$ is relatively large (24\% at $3\sigma$) and includes maximal mixing; the best fit occurs in the second octant ($\theta_{23} > \pi/4$), with the first octant being disfavoured with $\Delta\chi^2 = 6$. The preferred range for the complex phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$ is between $180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ and CP conservation is allowed with $\Delta\chi^2 = 1.8$.

    \caption{Three-flavour oscillation parameters from the NuFit-4.0 global
    analysis \cite{Esteban:2018azc}.
    The numbers in the 1st (2nd) column are obtained assuming normal (inverted) mass ordering,
    \textit{i.e.}, relative to the respective local $\chi^2$ minimum. The best fit point (bfp) is shown as the central value.
    Note that $\Delta m^2_{3\ell} \equiv \Delta m^2_{31} > 0$ for normal ordering and
    $\Delta m^2_{3\ell} \equiv \Delta m^2_{32} < 0$ for inverted ordering. Details on the parametrization and the used data samples can be found in Ref.\cite{Esteban:2018azc}.}
