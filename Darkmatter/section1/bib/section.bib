	abstract = {We study the capture, annihilation and evaporation of dark matter (DM) inside the Sun. It has been shown that the DM self-interaction can increase the DM number inside the Sun.   We demonstrate that this enhancement becomes more significant  in the regime of small DM mass, given a fixed DM self-interaction cross section.  This leads to the enhancement of neutrino flux from DM annihilation. On the other hand, for DM mass as low as as a few GeVs, not only the DM-nuclei scatterings can cause the DM evaporation, DM self-interaction also provides non-negligible contributions to this effect. Consequently, the critical mass for DM evaporation (typically 3 ∼ 4 GeV without the DM self-interaction)  can be slightly  increased.  We discuss the prospect of detecting DM self-interaction in IceCube-PINGU using the annihilation channels χχ → τ+τ-, νν̄ as examples. The PINGU sensitivities to DM self-interaction cross section σχχ are estimated for track and cascade events.}

abstract = {We report results of a search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS) with the silicon detectors of the CDMS II experiment. This blind analysis of 140.2 kg day of data taken between July 2007 and September 2008 revealed three WIMP-candidate events with a surface-event background estimate of ${0.41}_{\ensuremath{-}0.08}^{+0.20}(\mathrm{stat}{)}_{\ensuremath{-}0.24}^{+0.28}(\mathrm{syst})$. Other known backgrounds from neutrons and $^{206}\mathrm{Pb}$ are limited to ${\&}lt;0.13$ and ${\&}lt;0.08$ events at the 90\% confidence level, respectively. The exposure of this analysis is equivalent to 23.4 kg day for a recoil energy range of 7\char21{}100 keV for a WIMP of mass $10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$. The probability that the known backgrounds would produce three or more events in the signal region is 5.4\%. A profile likelihood ratio test of the three events that includes the measured recoil energies gives a 0.19\% probability for the known-background-only hypothesis when tested against the alternative $\mathrm{\text{WIMP}}+\mathrm{\text{background}}$ hypothesis. The highest likelihood occurs for a WIMP mass of $8.6\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{c}^{2}$ and WIMP-nucleon cross section of $1.9\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}41}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$.},

WIMP interactions with sensitive detectors are expected to display a characteristic annual modulation in rate. We release a dataset spanning 3.4 years of operation from a low-background germanium detector, designed to search for this signature. A previously reported modulation persists, concentrated in a region of the energy spectrum populated by an exponential excess of unknown origin. Its phase and period agree with phenomenological expectations, but its amplitude is a factor 4-7 larger than predicted for a standard WIMP galactic halo. We consider the possibility of a non-Maxwellian local halo velocity distribution as a plausible explanation, able to help reconcile recently reported WIMP search anomalies.},

abstract = "A new timing detector measuring ∼50MeV/c positrons is under development for the MEG II experiment, aiming at a time resolution σt∼30ps. The resolution is expected to be achieved by measuring each positron time with multiple counters made of plastic scintillator readout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the time resolution for ∼50MeV/c positrons using prototype counters. Counters with dimensions of 90×40×5mm3 readout by six SiPMs (three on each 40×5mm2 plane) were built with SiPMs from Hamamatsu Photonics and AdvanSiD and tested in a positron beam at the DAΦNE Beam Test Facility. The time resolution was found to improve nearly as the square root of the number of counter hits. A time resolution σt=26.2±1.3ps was obtained with eight counters with Hamamatsu SiPMs. These results suggest that the design resolution is achievable in the MEG II experiment."

A pixelated scintillation detector with an ultimate time resolution is under development for the positron time measurement in the upgraded experiment. Single pixel time resolutions better than 50ps (rms) are achieved with prototype counters and an excellent overall time resolution at a level of 30–35ps (rms) is found to be achievable in the full-scale detector by averaging the positron impact times over multiple hit counters."

A new method for terminating transmission lines and for "noiseless" damping which employs a capacitance in feedback is presented. It is shown that the position resolution for the charge division method with resistive electrodes is determined only by the electrode capacitance and not by the electrode resistance, if optimum filtering is used.},

	abstract = {Precision  measurements of solar neutrinos emitted by specific nuclear reaction chains in the Sun are of great interest for developing an improved understanding of star formation and evolution. Given the expected neutrino fluxes and known detection reactions, such measurements require detectors capable of collecting neutrino-electron scattering data in exposures on the order of 1 ktonne-yr, with good energy resolution and extremely low background.  Two-phase liquid argon time projection chambers (LAr TPCs) are under development for direct Dark Matter WIMP searches, which possess very large sensitive mass, high scintillation light yield, good energy resolution, and good spatial resolution in all three cartesian directions.  While enabling Dark Matter searches with sensitivity extending to the ``neutrino floor'' (given by the rate of nuclear recoil events from solar neutrino coherent scattering),  such detectors could also enable precision measurements of solar neutrino fluxes using the neutrino-electron elastic scattering events.
 Modeling results are presented for the cosmogenic and radiogenic backgrounds affecting solar neutrino detection in a 300 tonne (100 tonne fiducial) LAr TPC operating at LNGS depth (3,800 meters of water equivalent). The results show that such a detector could measure the CNO neutrino rate with ∼15% precision, and significantly improve the precision of the 7Be and pep neutrino rates compared to the currently available results from the Borexino organic liquid scintillator detector.}

We report on the methods developed for in-situ characterization and monitoring of DEAP’s 255 R5912-HQE PMTs. This includes a detailed discussion of typical measured single-photoelectron charge distributions, correlated noise (afterpulsing), dark noise, double, and late pulsing characteristics.

The use of liquid argon as the working medium and optimized readout results in an electronic noise contribution to the resolution of less than 0.1 GeV, in a large detector. The use of thin plates, 0.1 radiation length, ensures that sampling fluctuations are small The technique allows absolute calibration and very good gain stability. Tests on a detector large enough to absorb a high-energy electromagnetic shower are described, where the energy resolution is limited by the residual sampling fluctuations."

abstract = {The LZ experiment, featuring a 7-tonne active liquid xenon target, is aimed at achieving unprecedented sensitivity to WIMPs with the background expected to be dominated by astrophysical neutrinos. To reach this goal, extensive simulations are carried out to accurately calculate the electron recoil and nuclear recoil rates in the detector. Both internal (from target material) and external (from detector components and surrounding environment) backgrounds are considered. A very efficient suppression of background rate is achieved with an outer liquid scintillator veto, liquid xenon skin and fiducialisation. Based on the current measurements of radioactivity of different materials, it is shown that LZ can achieve the reduction of a total background for a WIMP search down to about 2 events in 1000 live days for 5.6 tonne fiducial mass.},

abstract = {SuperCDMS SNOLAB will be a next-generation experiment aimed at directly detecting low-mass particles (with masses $\ensuremath{\le}10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$) that may constitute dark matter by using cryogenic detectors of two types (HV and iZIP) and two target materials (germanium and silicon). The experiment is being designed with an initial sensitivity to nuclear recoil cross sections $\ensuremath{\sim}1\ifmmode\times\else\texttimes\fi{}{10}^{\ensuremath{-}43}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ for a dark matter particle mass of $1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$, and with capacity to continue exploration to both smaller masses and better sensitivities. The phonon sensitivity of the HV detectors will be sufficient to detect nuclear recoils from sub-GeV dark matter. A detailed calibration of the detector response to low-energy recoils will be needed to optimize running conditions of the HV detectors and to interpret their data for dark matter searches. Low-activity shielding, and the depth of SNOLAB, will reduce most backgrounds, but cosmogenically produced $^{3}\mathrm{H}$ and naturally occurring $^{32}\mathrm{Si}$ will be present in the detectors at some level. Even if these backgrounds are 10 times higher than expected, the science reach of the HV detectors would be over 3 orders of magnitude beyond current results for a dark matter mass of $1\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$. The iZIP detectors are relatively insensitive to variations in detector response and backgrounds, and will provide better sensitivity for dark matter particles with masses $\ensuremath{\gtrsim}5\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}/{\mathrm{c}}^{2}$. The mix of detector types (HV and iZIP), and targets (germanium and silicon), planned for the experiment, as well as flexibility in how the detectors are operated, will allow us to maximize the low-mass reach, and understand the backgrounds that the experiment will encounter. Upgrades to the experiment, perhaps with a variety of ultra-low-background cryogenic detectors, will extend dark matter sensitivity down to the ``neutrino floor,'' where coherent scatters of solar neutrinos become a limiting background.},

abstract = {As direct dark matter experiments continue to increase in size, they will become sensitive to neutrinos from astrophysical sources. For experiments that do not have directional sensitivity, coherent neutrino scattering from several sources represents an important background to understand, as it can almost perfectly mimic an authentic weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) signal. Here we explore in detail the effect of neutrino backgrounds on the discovery potential of WIMPs over the entire mass range of 500 MeV to 10 TeV. We show that, given the theoretical and measured uncertainties on the neutrino backgrounds, direct detection experiments lose sensitivity to light ($\ensuremath{\sim}10\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$) and heavy ($\ensuremath{\sim}100\text{ }\text{ }\mathrm{GeV}$) WIMPs with a spin-independent cross section below ${10}^{\ensuremath{-}45}$ and ${\text{10}}^{\ensuremath{-}49}\text{ }\text{ }{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$, respectively.},

A measurement of CEvNS on different nuclei will test the  N2-dependence of the CEvNS cross section and further the physics reach of the COHERENT effort. The first step of this program has been realized recently with the observation of CEvNS in a 14.6 kg CsI detector. Operation and deployment of Ge and NaI detectors are also underway.   A 22 kg, single-phase, liquid argon detector (CENNS-10) started  data-taking in Dec. 2016 and will provide results on CEvNS from a lighter nucleus.  Initial results indicate that light output, pulse-shape discrimination, and background suppression are sufficient for a measurement of CEvNS on argon.}

	abstract = {Detecting neutrinos{\textemdash}elementary particles that barely interact with other matter{\textemdash}usually requires detectors of enormous size. A particular interaction of neutrinos with atomic nuclei, called the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS), is predicted to occur with relatively high probability, and it could be used to drastically reduce the size of neutrino detectors. However, observing this interaction requires a source of low-energy neutrinos and detectors that contain nuclei of optimal mass. Akimov et al. observed CEνNS with a 6.7σ confidence by using a comparatively tiny, 14.6-kg sodium-doped CsI scintillator exposed to neutrinos from a spallation neutron facility (see the Perspective by Link). The discovery places tighter bounds on exotic, beyond-the-standard-model interactions involving neutrinos.Science, this issue p. 1123; see also p. 1098The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study neutrino properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7σ confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on nonstandard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set.},
